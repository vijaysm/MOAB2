/*
 * This example will show one of the building blocks of parallel infrastructure in MOAB
 * More exactly, if we have some homogeneous data to communicate from each processor to a list of other
 * processors, how do we do it?
 *
 * introduce the TupleList and crystal router to MOAB users.
 *
 * This technology is used in resolving shared vertices / sets between partitions
 * It is used in the mbcoupler for sending data (target points) to the proper processor, and communicate
 *   back the results.
 * Also, it is used to communicate departure mesh for intersection in parallel
 *
 *  It is a way of doing  MPI_gatheralltoallv(), when the communication matrix is sparse
 *
 *  It is assumed that every proc needs to communicate only with a few of the other processors.
 *  If every processor needs to communicate with all other, then we will have to use paired isend and irecv, the
 *  communication matrix is full
 *
 *  the example needs to be launched in parallel.
 *  Every proc will build a list of tuples, that will be send to a few procs;
 *  In general, we will send to num_comms tasks, and about num_tuples to each task
 *  We vary num_comms and num_tuples for processor
 *
 *  we will send long ints of the form
 *    100000 * send + 1000* rank +j, where j is the index of tuple
 *
 *  after routing, we verify we received
 *    100000 * rank + 1000 * from
 *
 *    For some reportrank we also print the tuples.
 *
 *  after routing, we will see if we received, as expected. Should run on at least 2 processors.
 *
 * Note: We do not need a moab instance for this example
