MOAB: Mesh-Oriented datA Base
Read Me

API version: 1.01
Implementation version: 2.00
=====================================

MOAB is a component for representing and evaluating mesh data.  MOAB
can store structured and unstructured mesh, consisting of elements in
the finite element "zoo".  The functional interface to MOAB is simple
yet powerful, allowing the representation of many types of metadata
commonly found on the mesh.  MOAB is optimized for efficiency in space
and time, based on access to mesh in chunks rather than through
individual entities, while also versatile enough to support individual
entity access.

MOAB can be used in several ways: as the underlying mesh data
representation for applications (MOAB is used in this way in the VERDE
mesh verification code, as a mesh input mechanism (using mesh readers
included with MOAB), or as a translator between mesh formats (using
readers and writers included with MOAB).

MOAB was developed as part of the CUBIT project at Sandia National
Laboratories, and was partially funded by the DOE SciDAC program as
part of the Terascale Tools and Technologies (TSTT) center.

=====================================
Dependencies
=====================================

MOAB depends on the NetCDF libraries (C and C++) to compile the
ExodusII reader/writer.  Support for C++ was added to netcdf in version 3.5.1, and 
took a bit of time to get compiling ironed out, so make sure you have version 3.6 or
later.  To get netcdf, search the web or try 
http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/.

The only MOAB file format that can represent the entire MOAB data model is
MOAB's native HDF5-based file format.  Support for this file format requires 
version 5 of the HDF library. It may be obtained at 
http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/.

=====================================
Compiling
=====================================

1. Unpack the source code in some directory.
2. Run the 'configure' script in the top source directory with the
   '--help' option to see a list of available configure options.
   '--prefix', '--with-netcdf', and '--with-hdf5' are common options
   specified.
3. From either the source directory or some other, empty directory,
   run the 'configure' script in the top source directory with any
   desired configuration options.
4. In whichever directory the configure script was run in, issue the
   command 'make' to compile MOAB and any configured MOAB-based tools.
5. In whichever directory MOAB was build in, issue the command 
   'make check' to verify that MOAB compiled and is working correctly.
6. Issue the command 'make install' to install the MOAB library and headers 
   in the configured install directory.  (This step is optional if you're 
   only building tools distributed with MOAB.)
